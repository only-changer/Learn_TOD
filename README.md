# Learn_TOD

This repo provides code for ICDE21 'Rebuilding City-Wide Traffic Origin Destination
from Road Speed Data'. 
Two ways to run:
1. run pretrain.py for training the TOD-Volume Mapping and Volume-Speed Mapping parts, and then run gen.py for training the TOD Generation part.
2. run run.py, which combines pretrain.py and gen.py and execute the two files sequentially.
